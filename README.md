# Narlikar_AnisotropicFluorimetry

Use the Jupyter notebook to fit data from anisotropic fluorimetry to binding curve in order to determine Rvalues and Kds.

##Note: 
you will need to replace the filenames in fileNames.csv with your excel files (full path and filename). The order matters! The files should be ordered as such:
```
blank VV
blank VH
blank HV
blank HH
standard HV
standard HH
sample_conc1 VV
sample_conc1 VH
sample_conc2 VV
sample_conc2 VH
etc.
```
see fileNames.csv for example! Make sure that fileNames.csv is in the same directory as your excel files and your jupyter notebook.
